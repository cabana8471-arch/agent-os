Now that we have a spec and tasks list ready for implementation, we will proceed with implementation of this spec by following this multi-phase process:

PHASE 1: Determine which task group(s) from tasks.md should be implemented
PHASE 2: Implement the given task(s)
PHASE 3: Perform code review on implemented code
PHASE 4: After ALL task groups have been implemented, produce the final verification report.

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names. Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

{{PHASE 1: @agent-os/commands/implement-tasks/single-agent/1-determine-tasks.md}}

{{PHASE 2: @agent-os/commands/implement-tasks/single-agent/2-implement-tasks.md}}

{{PHASE 3: @agent-os/commands/implement-tasks/single-agent/3-code-review.md}}

{{PHASE 4: @agent-os/commands/implement-tasks/single-agent/4-verify-implementation.md}}

## Completion

After all four phases are complete (determine tasks, implement, code review, verify):

**Implementation complete!** The verification report confirms this spec is fully implemented.

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Check the roadmap in `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` for remaining features
2. Run `/shape-spec` or `/write-spec` to start the next feature
3. Run `/analyze-features` to discover new feature opportunities
