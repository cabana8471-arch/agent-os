inherits_from: nextjs

# Override only files that differ from nextjs profile
# NOTE: Local files take precedence over inherited files, so only exclude files
# that don't have local overrides. Files with local versions (validation.md,
# error-handling.md, security.md) don't need to be excluded.
exclude_inherited_files:
  # Global overrides
  - standards/global/tech-stack.md
  - standards/global/project-structure.md

  # Backend overrides (Drizzle + BetterAuth vs Prisma + generic auth)
  - standards/backend/database.md
  - standards/backend/api.md
  - standards/backend/server-actions.md

  # Testing override (Vitest vs Jest)
