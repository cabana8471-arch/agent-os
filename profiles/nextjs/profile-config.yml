# Next.js profile overrides: exclude generic standards and replace with Next.js-specific
exclude_inherited_files:
  # Override these with Next.js App Router-specific versions:
  - standards/global/tech-stack.md
  - standards/global/coding-style.md
  - standards/frontend/components.md
  - standards/backend/api.md
  - standards/testing/test-writing.md

  # Exclude generic ORM standards (Next.js has its own database.md with Prisma):
  - standards/backend/models.md
  - standards/backend/migrations.md
  - standards/backend/queries.md

  # NOTE: project-structure.md, environment.md, routing.md are Next.js-specific
  # and don't exist in default profile (no need to exclude them)
