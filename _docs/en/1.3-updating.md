  How to Update Agent OS

This page documents how to update Agent OS including:

*   Upgrading your [base installation](#updating-base-installation) to the newest version of Agent OS
*   Pushing updates to your [project repositories](#updating-projects)

For notes on the latest version of Agent OS, see the [changelog](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

#### Backup before updating

It's always a good idea to create a backup of your Agent OS base installation before updating. The base update script will create `~/agent-os.backup` automatically, but this it's always good to have a manual backup, just in case.

**Note:** If you're upgrading from Agent OS 1.x to 2.x, see the [Version 2 Migration Guide](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/version-2).

Updating your base installation
-------------------------------

Your base installation in `~/agent-os` is the source where your project installations will be compiled from. Update your base installation so that you have the latest version of Agent OS available on your system.

**Note:** Updating your base installation will _not_ automatically update your project installations. You will need to update your project installations separately by [following these instructions below](#updating-projects).

### Running the base installation update

Copy Copied!

```
curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildermethods/agent-os/main/scripts/base-install.sh" | bash
```


### Choosing your update option

When you run the update script, you'll be presented with several update options. **For most users, option 1 (Full update) is recommended** as it updates your base installation to the latest version while preserving your important customizations.

1.  [Full update (Recommended)](#option-1-full-update)
2.  [Update default profile only](#option-2-profile-only)
3.  [Update scripts only](#option-3-scripts-only)
4.  [Update config.yml only](#option-4-config-only)
5.  [Delete & reinstall fresh](#option-5-reinstall-fresh)

#### 1\. Full update (Recommended)

**What it does:**

*   Updates and overwrites the default profile (`~/agent-os/profiles/default/*`)
*   Updates and overwrites all core scripts (`~/agent-os/scripts/*`)
*   Updates only the version number in `config.yml`
*   Updates `CHANGELOG.md`

**What's preserved:**

*   Your `config.yml` file's contents and settings remain completely intact (only the version number is updated)
*   All _custom_ profiles you've created remain completely intact

**When to use it:** This is the standard update path. Choose this option to get the latest Agent OS features while keeping your customizations safe.

#### Best Practice: Custom Profiles

If you're making customizations to standards or workflows, create a [custom profile](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/profiles) rather than editing the default profile. This makes updates seamless—your custom profiles are never touched during updates, so you can safely run option 1 without worrying about losing your work.

#### 2\. Update default profile only

**What it does:** Updates and overwrites only the files in `~/agent-os/profiles/default/*`. Everything else in your `~/agent-os` folder remains completely unchanged.

**When to use it:** Choose this if you specifically want to refresh just the default profile without updating scripts or other components.

#### 3\. Update scripts only

**What it does:** Updates and overwrites only the files in `~/agent-os/scripts/*`. Everything else remains unchanged.

**When to use it:** Choose this if you need to update just the installation and compilation scripts, perhaps to get a bug fix in the scripts without affecting your profiles.

#### 4\. Update config.yml only

**What it does:** Updates and overwrites only the `~/agent-os/config.yml` file. Everything else remains unchanged.

**When to use it:** Choose this in rare cases where you need to update just the configuration file structure.

#### 5\. Delete & reinstall fresh

**What it does:**

*   Creates a backup of your entire `~/agent-os` folder at `~/agent-os.backup`
*   Deletes your existing `~/agent-os` folder and all of its contents
*   Installs a completely fresh Agent OS base installation

**When to use it:** Choose this if you want to start completely fresh or if you're experiencing issues with your current installation. You can restore any customizations from the backup afterward.

Updating your project installations
-----------------------------------

After you've updated your base installation, or after you've made changes to your base installation, you can push those updates to individual project installations. The update process has been simplified in Agent OS 2.1 to make it easier and more predictable.

### Running a project update

Navigate to the root of your project directory:

Copy Copied!

```
cd /path/to/your/project
```


You can use either the explicit project update script:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-update.sh
```


Or re-run the installation script (it will automatically detect and update existing installations):

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh
```


### How the update process works

When you run a project update, the script will:

1.  Check your current Agent OS configuration
2.  Compare it with the incoming Agent OS version and configuration
3.  Show you what will change and ask you to confirm before proceeding
4.  Preserve your important project data (specs and product docs)
5.  Delete and re-install everything else from your base installation

### What gets preserved

The following folders are **always preserved** during updates and never deleted:

*   `agent-os/product/*` - Your product roadmap, mission, and tech stack
*   `agent-os/specs/*` - All your feature specs and implementations

### What gets re-installed

The following are **completely deleted and re-installed** from your base installation (using your selected [profile](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/profiles) and [configuration options](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/modes)):

*   `agent-os/standards` - All standards from your profile
*   `agent-os/commands` - If `agent_os_commands: true`
*   `.claude/commands/agent-os/` - If `claude_code_commands: true`
*   `.claude/agents/agent-os/` - If using Claude Code with `use_claude_code_subagents: true`
*   `.claude/skills` - If using [Claude Code Skills](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/skills) with `standards_as_claude_code_skills: true`

#### Managing customizations

If you've made customizations to any of the files that get re-installed (standards, commands, workflows, etc.) directly in your project installation, you'll need to either:

*   Back up those customizations before updating and re-apply them afterward
*   **Better approach:** Make your customizations in your [base installation's profile](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/profiles) so they automatically get compiled into your project on every update

Common update scenarios
