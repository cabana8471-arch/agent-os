  Planning a Product Roadmap with Agent OS

The **`plan-product`** command kicks off this essential first phase of the [spec-driven development workflow with Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflow). It is typically run only once at the beginning a new project, or on the day you install Agent OS into an existing project.

The product planning phase is where you define the strategic product mission, its projected feature development roadmap, and its technology stack.

What gets created
-----------------

The `plan-product` command ultimately creates three core documents in your project's product folder: `agent-os/product/`:

*   **mission.md** - Product mission, vision, target users, use cases, differentiators, etc.
*   **roadmap.md** - Prioritized feature list to serve as a general guide for development.
*   **tech-stack.md** - Technology choices for frontend, backend, infrastructure, etc.

These documents are then used by your agents when planning specs and implementing features to ensure alignment with your high-level goals of your product.

How to run
----------

### 

Claude Code

Run command, /plan-product

When using Agent OS with Claude Code commands enabled, run:

Copy Copied!

```
/plan-product
```


The product-planner subagent will then gather information interactively and create all documents in the `agent-os/product/` folder.

### 

Other Tools

Two ways to run this command

When using other AI coding tools, you have two options for running this command:

**Option A: Run all steps in one shot**

This single command instructs your agent to run all four steps automatically in sequence. Some agents perform better at this than others.

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/plan-product/plan-product.md run this
```


**Option B: Run each numbered step manually**

For more control and reliability, run each numbered command sequentially:

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/plan-product/1-plan-product.md run this
```


Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/plan-product/2-create-mission.md run this
```


Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/plan-product/3-create-roadmap.md run this
```


Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/plan-product/4-create-tech-stack.md run this
```


Next step
---------

Now that you have your product plan documented, you're ready to start planning your first spec.
