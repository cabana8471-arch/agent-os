  Writing a Spec with Agent OS

The **`write-spec`** command is the second step in the repeatable feature development cycle in the [spec-driven development workflow with Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflow).

This phase takes your requirements from [shape-spec](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/shape-spec) and formalizes them into a clear, comprehensive specification document.

What gets created
-----------------

The `write-spec` command creates one core document in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/`:

*   **spec.md** - Comprehensive specification with user stories, requirements, reusable components, technical approach, visual references, and scope boundaries

How to run
----------

### 

Claude Code

Run command, /write-spec

When using Agent OS with Claude Code commands enabled, run:

### 

Other Tools

Two ways to run this command

When using other AI coding tools, you have two options for running this command:

**Option A: Run all steps in one shot**

This single command instructs your agent to complete the entire write-spec process automatically. Some agents perform better at this than others.

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/write-spec/write-spec.md run this
```


**Option B: Run each numbered step manually**

For more control and reliability, you can run each numbered command sequentially. Check your `agent-os/commands/write-spec/` folder for the numbered command files.

Next step
---------

With your specification written, you're ready to break it down into tasks.
