  Using Visuals for UI Design with Agent OS

Visuals enable Agent OS to direct your agents build interfaces that match your design vision. By including mockups, wireframes, or screenshots during the research phase, you give agents a clear visual target for implementation.

Including visuals is entirely optional, but when provided, they help reduce ambiguity and ensure the final implementation aligns with your expectations.

*   [Fidelity levels](#fidelity-levels)

*   [Playwright integration](#playwright-integration)

When and where to add visuals
-----------------------------

Visuals are gathered during the research phase, which happens when you run the [shape-spec](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/shape-spec) command.

During this phase, Agent OS will prompt you about whether you have visual assets to include. If you do, place them in:

Copy Copied!

```
agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/visuals/
```


Commonly used formats for visuals: PNG, JPG, JPEG, PDF

Agent OS automatically detects and analyzes visual files in this folder, even if you don't explicitly mention them during the research phase.

File naming conventions
-----------------------

Give your visual files descriptive names that clearly indicate what they represent:

#### ❌ Not descriptive

`Screen Shot 2025-01-15.png   mockup-v3-final.jpg   image1.png`

#### ✅ Descriptive

`user-profile-page.png   dashboard-mobile-320px.jpg   checkout-flow-wireframe.png`

Consider including additional details in filenames:

*   **Component or page name:** `user-profile-page.png`
*   **Viewport size:** `dashboard-mobile-320px.jpg`
*   **State or variation:** `form-validation-errors.png`
*   **Fidelity level:** `checkout-flow-wireframe.png`

Fidelity levels
---------------

Different visual assets serve different purposes. Agent OS recognizes two fidelity levels:

### 

High-fidelity

Detailed mockups for exact implementation

High-fidelity mockups are detailed designs that agents should match closely, including exact colors, typography, spacing, and visual effects.

By default, Agent OS treats all visuals as high-fidelity unless you indicate otherwise.

### 

Low-fidelity

Wireframes for structural guidance

Low-fidelity wireframes are rough layouts that provide structural guidance without dictating exact styling. Agents will use these for layout and component placement while applying your app's existing design system.

To indicate a visual is low-fidelity, include one of these keywords in the filename:

*   `lofi` or `lo-fi`
*   `wireframe`
*   `sketch`
*   `rough`

Example: `homepage-wireframe.png` or `checkout-lofi-sketch.jpg`

How visuals are used throughout the workflow
--------------------------------------------

Visual assets are referenced at multiple stages of the [Agent OS workflow](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflow):

### 

1

Research phase

During [shape-spec](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/shape-spec), Agent OS prompts you to add visuals and automatically detects any files placed in the `planning/visuals/` folder.

It will then analyze the visuals and ask you clarifying questions based on what it "sees" in them, to help you refine the planning of this feature spec.

### 

2

Specification phase

During [write-spec](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/write-spec), Agent OS references the visuals when generating the spec, mapping UI components and requirements to the visual assets.

### 

3

Implementation phase

During [implement-tasks](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/implement-tasks) or [orchestrate-tasks](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/orchestrate-tasks), your agents reference the visuals to build components that match the design.

### 

4

Verification phase

During [final verification](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/verification), your agents compare the implementation against the original visuals to ensure alignment.

Playwright integration
----------------------

Agent OS includes [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) integration for browser-based visual verification. This enables agents to launch browsers, take screenshots, and compare implementations against your visual assets.

Using Playwright is optional. Without it, your agents can still analyze your visual assets and use them to guide their work. However, it's highly recommended since it adds a lot more reliability and accuracy to agents' visual UI implementation. And it's free!

To install Playwright, [follow the instructions in the Playwright MCP repository](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).

### Using Playwright with your agents

When creating custom [Claude Code subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) for UI implementation, you can give them access to Playwright tools for browser-based verification.

Simply include Playwright in the tools available to your custom subagent. [Learn more about the Playwright MCP integration](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).
