  Final Verification with Agent OS

Agent OS includes a final verification step at the end of your feature implementation to ensure quality and completeness before shipping.

What gets verified
------------------

The final verification checks:

*   **Task completion** - All tasks in tasks.md are checked off
*   **Tests passing** - All tests run successfully
*   **Alignment with standards** - Implementation follows your coding standards
*   **Roadmap updates** - Your [product roadmap](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/plan-product) reflects the new feature

When verification happens
-------------------------

Final verification runs automatically at the end of both [implement-tasks](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/implement-tasks) and [orchestrate-tasks](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/orchestrate-tasks) workflows.

Verification report
-------------------

A verification report is created at `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/verification/final-verification.md` documenting the results of all checks.
