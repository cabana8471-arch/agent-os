  Agent OS Workflows system for your development process

Workflows are modular instruction blocks that Agent OS uses to assemble consistent instructions across [configuration options](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/modes) and commands. They're the building blocks that power the [spec-driven development workflow](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflow).

**Most users never need to customize workflows.** Agent OS includes a comprehensive set of pre-built workflows that handle the entire development process. But if you want fine-grain control over how instructions are assembled and how [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards) get injected into your agents, understanding workflows helps.

This page covers:

*   [How workflows are organized](#how-workflows-are-organized)

*   [Conditional compilation tags](#conditional-tags)
*   [When to customize workflows](#when-to-customize)

What workflows are
------------------

Workflows are reusable markdown files containing instructions for specific parts of the development process. They get injected into:

*   **Command files** - Instructions for Agent OS commands that guide your development workflow
*   **Custom Claude Code subagents** - When creating specialized subagents for complex orchestration

This modular approach ensures consistency: the same process instructions appear everywhere they're needed, regardless of your [configuration options](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/modes).

How workflows are organized
---------------------------

Workflows live inside your [profiles](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/profiles) and follow the same inheritance system as [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards).

The default profile organizes workflows by development phase:

When you [install Agent OS into a project](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/installation), these workflows are compiled into your project's commands and agents based on your active profile.

How the injection system works
------------------------------

Agent OS uses a simple injection syntax to embed workflows (and [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards)) wherever instructions are needed.

### Workflow injection syntax

Workflows are injected using this syntax in any command, agent, or workflow file:

Copy Copied!

```
{{workflows/specification/write-spec}}
```


During project installation, Agent OS finds this placeholder and replaces it with the contents of `write-spec.md`.

### Standards injection syntax

Similarly, [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards) get injected using this syntax:

Copy Copied!

```
{{standards/global/*}}
{{standards/backend/database}}
```


The `*` wildcard includes all files in that folder. Without it, you're referencing a specific file (without the `.md` extension).

**Note:** An important difference between injecting standards vs. workflows: standards are injected as a list of @ references to the files in your project's `agent-os/standards` folder, while workflows are injected as the file contents themselves.

### How compilation happens

When you run [project installation](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/installation), Agent OS:

1.  Scans all command and agent files for injection placeholders
2.  Locates the referenced workflow or standard files in your active profile
3.  Replaces each placeholder with the file contents
4.  Validates that all referenced files exist

The result is fully compiled commands and agents with all instructions assembled and ready to use.

Workflows can include conditional tags that show or hide content based on your project's [configuration options](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/modes). This allows workflows to adapt automatically to different setups without requiring multiple versions.

### Available conditional tags

Use these tags to conditionally include or exclude content during compilation:

*   **`{{IF condition}}` ... `{{ENDIF condition}}`** - Include content when condition is true
*   **`{{UNLESS condition}}` ... `{{ENDUNLESS condition}}`** - Include content when condition is false

### Common configuration conditions

The most frequently used conditions in workflows are:

*   `use_claude_code_subagents` - True when using [Claude Code subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) for task orchestration
*   `standards_as_claude_code_skills` - True when using [Claude Code Skills integration](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/skills) for standards application

### Example: Adaptive workflow instructions

Here's how the orchestrate-tasks workflow adapts to different configurations:

Copy Copied!

```
{{IF use_claude_code_subagents}}
## Delegating to subagents

For each task group in orchestration.yml:
1. Identify which specialized subagent should handle it
2. Create a new agent session for that subagent
3. Provide the task group and relevant context

{{ENDIF use_claude_code_subagents}}
{{UNLESS standards_as_claude_code_skills}}
## Assigning standards

For each task group, specify which standards should guide implementation.
You can reference standards using paths like:
- `all` - All standards from every folder
- `global/*` - All standards from the global folder
- `frontend/components.md` - A specific standard file

{{ENDUNLESS standards_as_claude_code_skills}}
```


During compilation, Agent OS evaluates these conditions:

*   **If subagents are enabled:** Instructions for delegating to subagents are included
*   **If Skills integration is disabled:** Instructions for manual standards assignment are included
*   **Otherwise:** Those sections are omitted entirely

This ensures agents receive only the instructions relevant to their specific configuration, reducing noise and improving clarity.

When and how to customize workflows
-----------------------------------

Most users work with the default workflows indefinitely without needing customization.

If you do choose to customize, **start small**. Make minor tweaks to existing workflows before attempting major rewrites. Only work up to larger customizations once you have a firm understanding of how the Agent OS system works.

### Most common customization: changing injection points

The most common reason to customize workflows is adjusting where individual workflows or standards are injected. For example:

*   Adding specific standards to certain agents but not others
*   Changing which verification workflows run for different implementers
*   Removing standards that don't apply to your tech stack

### Other reasons to customize

*   **Add project-specific processes** - Your team has unique deployment or testing workflows
*   **Modify instruction phrasing** - You want agents to follow different communication patterns
*   **Create specialized workflows** - You have unique development phases or processes

### 

Customizing

Overriding workflows in custom profiles

To customize a workflow, use [profile inheritance](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/profiles):

1.  Create or use a custom profile that inherits from `default` (or another existing profile)
2.  Copy the workflow file you want to modify from `profiles/default/workflows/`
3.  Place it in the same path within your custom profile
4.  Modify as needed—your version will be used instead of the default

Example: To override how specs are written, create:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/profiles/my-profile/workflows/specification/write-spec.md
```


When you install this profile into a project, your custom version will be used everywhere `{{workflows/specification/write-spec}}` appears.

### 

Creating

Adding new workflows

To create entirely new workflows:

1.  Add a new markdown file in your profile's `workflows/` folder
2.  Write self-contained, reusable instructions
3.  Inject it using `{{workflows/[path]/[name]}}` in commands or agents

Example workflow in `~/agent-os/profiles/my-profile/workflows/deployment/deploy-staging.md`:

Copy Copied!

```
# Deploy to Staging

After implementation is verified:

1. Run the staging deployment script:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```

2. Verify the deployment at https://staging.example.com

3. Run smoke tests to ensure core functionality works
```


Then inject it into a verification workflow or custom command:

Copy Copied!

```
## Final Steps
{{workflows/deployment/deploy-staging}}
```


You can also reference it when creating custom [Claude Code subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) for orchestrated task execution.

Finding injection points
------------------------

To see where a specific workflow is used, search your profile:

Copy Copied!

```
grep -r "{{workflows/implementation/verify" ~/agent-os/profiles/default/
```


This shows all commands, agents, and workflows that inject this specific workflow, helping you understand the impact of any changes.
