  Defining Coding Standards with Agent OS

Standards are markdown files containing your coding conventions, patterns, and best practices. They ensure AI agents write code that looks like _you_ wrote it.

Standards define how code should be written in your projects—variable naming, error handling, API design, component architecture. Not generic guidelines, but _your_ specific rules.

This page covers:

*   [Where standards live](#where-standards-live)
*   [Customizing your standards](#customizing-your-standards)
*   [Creating effective standards](#creating-effective-standards)
*   [How standards are applied](#how-standards-are-applied)

Where standards live
--------------------

Standards should be managed and stored in your [Agent OS base installation](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/installation). They are then compiled into your project installation based on which [profile](#) you're using in that project.

Your base installation's default profile comes with this folder structure for standards:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/profiles/default/standards/
├── backend/
├── frontend/
├── global/
└── testing/
```


You can store as many individual standards files inside of these folders, create additional subfolders as needed, or reorganize them as you see fit.

**Note:** For the easiest "out of the box" experience, it's best to keep your standards folder organized by those four sub-folders: `backend, frontend, global, testing`, since the injection points are already set up for these. But if you wish to customize this structure, [read below for details on how to customize the standards injection points to match your structure](#how-standards-are-applied).

**Special file:** The `global/tech-stack.md` file is used to define your default tech stack choices. This file is automatically checked when you run the [plan-product command](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/plan-product), which establishes your tech stack choices for the current project.

Claude Code Skills Integration
------------------------------

As of Agent OS 2.1+, Agent OS can convert your standards into [Claude Code Skills](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/skills), allowing Claude to automatically apply relevant standards as needed during implementation with greater context efficiency.

This feature is enabled by default and applies when `claude_code_commands: true` and `standards_as_claude_code_skills: true` in your `~/agent-os/config.yml`.

When Skills integration is enabled:

*   Standards are not injected as explicit file references
*   Each standard file becomes a separate Claude Code Skill
*   Claude automatically determines which standards are relevant for each task
*   Token usage is significantly reduced compared to explicit standard injection

Customizing your standards
--------------------------

**Best practice:** Create a custom [profile](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/profiles) that inherits from the `default` profile rather than editing the default profile directly. This makes updating your base installation easier—you won't lose your customizations when updating.

When you create a custom profile with inheritance, you only need to add or override the specific standards files that differ from the default. All other standards are automatically inherited from the parent profile.

**Note:** In your custom profile, you specify which profile to inherit from by setting the `inherits_from` value in your profile's `profile-config.yml` file.

### Common profile organization pattern

Many developers organize their profiles in layers of inheritance:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/profiles/
├── default/          # Base profile (don't customize)
├── general/          # Your main custom profile
│   └── standards/    # General tweaks to defaults
├── rails/            # Tech-stack-specific profile
│   └── standards/    # Rails-specific standards
└── react/            # Tech-stack-specific profile
    └── standards/    # React-specific standards
```


In this pattern:

*   `default` remains unchanged for easy updates
*   `general` (or name it anything you want) inherits from `default` and contains your common customizations
*   `rails` inherits from `general` and adds Rails-specific standards
*   `react` inherits from `general` and adds React-specific standards

You can also create additional, more specialized profiles that inherit from your tech-stack profiles, creating as many layers of inheritance as needed for your workflow.

Creating effective standards
----------------------------

### Start small

1.  Get started with Agent OS using minimal standards
2.  Notice what you're frequently fixing
3.  Add a standard for that pattern
4.  Watch the corrections disappear

### Keep standards modular

Use specific, focused files rather than monolithic documents:

#### ❌ Monolithic

`standards/all-standards.md`

#### ✅ Modular

`standards/frontend/   ├── react-hooks.md   ├── component-props.md   ├── state-management.md   └── styling.md`

### Be specific and actionable

Good standards are clear and implementable:

#### ❌ Vague

`"Write clean code with good naming"`

#### ✅ Specific

`"Use camelCase for variables Use descriptive names (getUserById not getUser) Prefix booleans with is/has/should"`

### Best practices

*   **Keep actionable:** Focus on concrete patterns with clear examples
*   **Include examples:** Always provide examples of how to follow the standard
*   **Keep modular:** Use specific, focused files rather than monolithic documents
*   **Start minimal:** Begin with very few standards, add as needed
*   **Document your why:** Include brief explanations of patterns
*   **Avoid over-specification:** Focus on patterns that matter to you and your team for consistency

How standards are applied
-------------------------

**Note:** This section explains how Agent OS works _"under the hood."_ You don't necessarily need to customize how and where standards get injected. For the simplest use case, it's best to keep your standards folder organized by the four sub-folders: `backend, frontend, global, and testing`, since the injection points are already set up for these.

However, if you choose to reorganize or add additional subfolders and want to dial in exactly which standards are injected into which workflows and agents, read on to understand how that works and how you can customize things.

Agent OS intelligently injects relevant standards into agent instructions and workflows. For example:

*   Database agents get database standards
*   UI agents get frontend standards
*   API agents get backend and API standards
*   All agents get global standards

### Injection syntax

You'll find instances of the following injection tags sprinkled throughout your profile's [workflows](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflows) and commands files. During your [project installation process](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/installation), Agent OS will compile your profile's agents and workflows and replace these injection tags with references that point to the specified standards files.

When you see something like this:

Copy Copied!

```
{{standards/global/*}}
```


That will be replaced with a list of references to _all_ files and sub-folders inside the `global` folder, which ends up looking like this:

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/standards/global/naming.md
@agent-os/standards/global/code-style.md
@agent-os/standards/global/best-practices.md
@agent-os/standards/global/testing.md
```


If a tag points to the name of a specific file (not a folder), like this:

Copy Copied!

```
{{standards/backend/database}}
```


That will be replaced with a reference to the `database.md` file which ends up looking like this:

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/standards/backend/database.md
```


In many cases, multiple sets of standards will be injected to form a complete set of standards for an agent or workflow. For example:

Copy Copied!

```
{{standards/global/*}}
{{standards/frontend/components}}
{{standards/frontend/css}}
```


To find all injection points, search your profile folder for `{{standards`.

### Standards injected into workflows and agents

Standards are injected into your workflows and agents during the [project installation process](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/installation). The injection points are defined in your profile's workflow files and command files.

When creating custom [Claude Code subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents), you can inject references to relevant standards files in their instructions for better alignment with your coding standards.
