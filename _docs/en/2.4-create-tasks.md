  Creating a Task List with Agent OS

The **`create-tasks`** command is the third step in the repeatable feature development cycle in the [spec-driven development workflow with Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflow).

This phase takes your spec and breaks it down into a strategically ordered task list, organized into task groups by specialty.

What gets created
-----------------

The `create-tasks` command creates one core document in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/`:

*   **tasks.md** - Task breakdown with tasks grouped by specialty (database, API, UI, testing), strategically ordered, typically following a test-driven development approach (TDD)

How to run
----------

### 

Claude Code

Run command, /create-tasks

When using Agent OS with Claude Code commands enabled, run:

Copy Copied!

```
/create-tasks
```


### 

Other Tools

Two ways to run this command

When using other AI coding tools, you have two options for running this command:

**Option A: Run all steps in one shot**

This single command instructs your agent to complete the entire create-tasks process automatically. Some agents perform better at this than others.

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/create-tasks/create-tasks.md run this
```


**Option B: Run each numbered step manually**

For more control and reliability, you can run each numbered command sequentially. Check your `agent-os/commands/create-tasks/` folder for the numbered command files.

Next step
---------

Now that you have your task breakdown complete, you're ready to implement the feature.

You can choose either [implement-tasks](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/implement-tasks) for simple implementation or [orchestrate-tasks](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/orchestrate-tasks) for advanced orchestration.
