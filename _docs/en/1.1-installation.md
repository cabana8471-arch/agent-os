  How to Install Agent OS

Agent OS uses a two-step installation: first install the base system to your home directory, then compile it into individual projects.

1

Base installation


------------------------

Run the base installation script to install Agent OS to your home directory:

Copy Copied!

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildermethods/agent-os/main/scripts/base-install.sh | bash
```


This creates `~/agent-os` with the default profile containing standards, workflows, agents, and installation scripts.

**Alternatively:** You can manually download the files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) and place them in your home directory at `~/agent-os/`.

**Updating?** If you already have Agent OS installed, you'll be prompted with update options and the ability to create a backup. For more information on updating, see the [updating guide](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/updating).

**Windows Users:** The installation command requires a bash shell. We recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which provides a full Linux environment on Windows. Alternatively, you can use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (included with Git for Windows) to run the installation command. Once installed, open your bash terminal and run the curl command above.

### Customize your standards

Before installing Agent OS into your projects, take time to customize your coding standards. This is one of the most important steps—your standards define how agents understand and build your code.

**Best practice:** Create a [custom profile](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/profiles) that inherits from the `default` profile rather than editing the default profile directly. This makes updating your base installation easier without losing your customizations. Edit the files in your custom profile's `standards/` folder to match your conventions, preferred frameworks, and architectural patterns.

### For Claude Code users with Skills enabled

If you're using [Claude Code Skills integration](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/skills) (enabled by default when `standards_as_claude_code_skills: true`), run the `/improve-skills` command after customizing your standards or after installing Agent OS into a project.

This command analyzes each Skill and optimizes its description to improve how Claude recognizes when to apply it, ensuring your standards get used effectively throughout your development workflow.

Project installation


---------------------------

Navigate to your project:

Copy Copied!

```
cd /path/to/your/project
```


Install Agent OS:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh
```


The installer will use your defaults from `~/agent-os/config.yml` or prompt you for:

*   Which [profile](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/profiles) to use (default: `default`)
*   Your [configuration options](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/modes) for Claude Code commands, subagents, and standards

### What gets installed

The project installation compiles from your base:

*   [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards) from your chosen profile
*   commands adapted for your configuration options
*   [workflows](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflows) configured for your project

This creates:

*   `agent-os/` folder with standards and workflows
*   `.claude/` folder with commands (only when `claude_code_commands: true`)

### Configuration defaults

Set defaults in `~/agent-os/config.yml`:

Copy Copied!

```
defaults:
  profile: default
  claude_code_commands: true
  use_claude_code_subagents: true
  agent_os_commands: false
  standards_as_claude_code_skills: true
```


### Installation options

Override defaults using flags:

#### Description

Choose which profile to compile from

#### Flag

`--claude-code-commands`

#### Description

Enable/disable Claude Code commands

#### Flag

`--use-claude-code-subagents`

#### Description

Enable/disable delegating to Claude Code subagents

#### Description

Enable/disable Agent OS prompt commands

#### Flag

`--standards-as-claude-code-skills`

#### Description

#### Description

Preview what would be installed

#### Description

Show detailed output

### Example flag usage

Use a different profile:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh --profile nextjs
```


Enable Claude Code with subagents:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh --claude-code-commands true --use-claude-code-subagents true
```


Enable Claude Code without subagents:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh --claude-code-commands true --use-claude-code-subagents false
```


Enable for other AI coding tools:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh --agent-os-commands true
```


Enable Claude Code Skills:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh --claude-code-commands true --standards-as-claude-code-skills true
```


Preview installation without running it:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh --dry-run
```
