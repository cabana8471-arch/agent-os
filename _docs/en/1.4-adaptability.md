  Adapting Agent OS to any AI Coding Tool

Agent OS is designed to work with any AI coding tool. Whether you use Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Windsurf, or whatever hot new tool drops next week, **you can use Agent OS with it**.

Agent OS adapts to your tool through flexible [configuration options](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/modes) that let you enable the features your tool supports:

*   [Using with Claude Code](#claude-code) - Full integration with commands, subagents, and Skills
*   [Using with other tools](#other-tools) - Sequential prompt-based workflow for any AI coding tool

Using Agent OS with Claude Code
-------------------------------

Claude Code provides the most integrated experience with Agent OS through native support for slash commands, [subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents), and [Skills](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/skills).

When configured for Claude Code (`claude_code_commands: true`), Agent OS:

*   Generates slash commands in your `.claude/commands/agent-os/` folder (like `/shape-spec`, `/write-spec`, `/create-tasks`)
*   Optionally converts your [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards) into [Claude Code Skills](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/skills) for intelligent, context-efficient standards application
*   Enables [orchestration with specialized subagents](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/orchestrate-tasks) when `use_claude_code_subagents: true`
*   Provides the complete [spec-driven development workflow](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflow) through easy-to-use slash commands

Agent OS works with any AI coding tool through a sequential prompt-based workflow. When configured for other tools (`agent_os_commands: true`), Agent OS generates markdown command files that you can reference in your tool's chat interface.

When configured for other AI tools, Agent OS:

*   Generates workflow command files in your `agent-os/commands/` folder
*   Injects your [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards) and [workflows](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflows) into each command
*   Provides clear, step-by-step prompts for the [complete development workflow](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflow)

### Running commands in other tools

Agent OS provides two ways to run each workflow command with other AI tools:

**Option A:** Run the main command file, which instructs your agent to complete all steps automatically. For example:

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/write-spec/write-spec.md run this
```


**Option B:** Run each numbered command file sequentially for more control and reliability. For example:

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/write-spec/1-[step-name].md run this
@agent-os/commands/write-spec/2-[step-name].md run this
```


Some agents perform better with Option A, while others work better with the step-by-step approach of Option B.

Follow the [Agent OS workflow](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflow) to see the complete sequence of commands for building features with your AI tool. Each workflow page shows both options.
