  Agent OS Profiles for different project types

Profiles are complete configuration packages for Agent OS containing standards, roles, workflows, and templates. Switch profiles to adapt Agent OS to different tech stacks or project types.

This page covers:

*   [When to use multiple profiles](#when-to-use-multiple-profiles)
*   [Profile inheritance](#profile-inheritance)
*   [Profile configuration](#profile-configuration)
*   [Creating custom profiles](#creating-custom-profiles)

The default profile
-------------------

Every [Agent OS base installation](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/installation) starts with a `default` profile—your foundation for standards and patterns used across most projects.

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/profiles/default/
├── standards/
│   ├── global/...
│   ├── backend/...
│   ├── frontend/...
│   └── testing/...
├── workflows/...
├── agents/...
└── commands/...
```


**Best practice:** Keep the `default` profile unchanged and create custom profiles that inherit from it. This makes updating your base installation easier—you won't lose your customizations when updating. Most developers create a "main" custom profile (often called `general`, `main`, or `custom`) that inherits from `default` and contains their common tweaks and preferences.

When to use multiple profiles
-----------------------------

Create additional profiles when you:

*   **Switch between tech stacks:** For example, Rails projects vs Node.js projects
*   **Have different project types:** For example, web apps vs CLI tools vs mobile apps
*   **Work with different teams:** Where each team has its own conventions
*   **Manage client projects:** Different clients, different standards

Profile inheritance
-------------------

Instead of duplicating everything for each profile, inherit from a parent profile and override only what's different.

### How inheritance works

1.  Start with a parent (usually `default`)
2.  Inherit all standards, roles, and workflows
3.  Override specific files with your customizations
4.  Add new elements unique to this profile

### Example

Creating a `django-api` profile that inherits from `default` (or from your main custom profile):

In `~/agent-os/profiles/django-api/profile-config.yml`:

Copy Copied!

```
inherits_from: default
```


Only override what's different:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/profiles/django-api/
├── profile-config.yml
└──  standards/
    └── backend/
        ├── django-models.md
        └── django-views.md
```


Profile configuration
---------------------

Each profile has a `profile-config.yml` file:

Copy Copied!

```
inherits_from: default

exclude_inherited_files:
  - standards/backend/api.md
```


You can use the `exclude_inherited_files` section to exclude specific files from being inherited from the parent profile.

Profile inheritance can continue through multiple layers. For example, a common pattern is: `rails-api` → `rails` → `general` → `default`, where each profile only defines what's different from its parent.

If you set `inherits_from` to `false`, then this profile will _not_ inherit from any parent profile.

Creating custom profiles
------------------------

You can create a new profile using the `create-profile.sh` script.

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/create-profile.sh
```


This script creates the profile directory structure, sets up the configuration file, establishes inheritance, and creates placeholder directories. You can then copy and edit files from the `default` (or other) profile that you want to override in this new profile.

Using profiles
--------------

To set the default profile used on all project installations, set this in your base installation's `~/agent-os/config.yml`:

Copy Copied!

```
default_profile: general
```


This example uses `general` as the default profile—a common pattern where `general` is your main custom profile that inherits from `default`.

To install Agent OS into a project using a different profile than your default, use the `--profile` flag:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh --profile django-api
```


See [installation guide](#) for details.

### Switching profiles on a project

If your project installation initially used one profile, but you want to switch to a different profile, you can re-run the project installation script with the new profile:

Copy Copied!

```
~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh --profile react-app
```


This will detect your project's current installation and configuration and present you with a list of options for how you wish to proceed with the update, including re-installing Agent OS with the new profile.

The same process applies if you've updated your base installation's profile and need to push those updates to your project installation. Again, just re-run the project installation script and ensure the correct profile is specified.
