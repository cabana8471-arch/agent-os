  Agent OS | The system for spec-driven development with AI coding agents

What is Agent OS?
-----------------

Agent OS is a spec-driven development system that gives AI agents the structured context they need to write production-quality code. It provides your AI with clear specifications, standards, and workflows—transforming inconsistent outputs into reliable, production-ready implementations.

### How it works

Agent OS uses a **3-layer context system**:

1.  **Standards** - How you build (your coding standards that train your AI agents)
2.  **Product** - What you're building and why (vision and roadmap and use-cases)
3.  **Specs** - What you're building next (specific features with implementation details)

### Works with any AI coding tool

Agent OS adapts to your preferred AI coding tool through flexible configuration options:

*   **Claude Code** - Use Agent OS with Claude Code commands and optionally delegate to subagents for advanced orchestration
*   **Other tools** (Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Windsurf, etc.) - Use Agent OS commands as sequential prompts in any AI coding tool
