  Claude Code Skills Integration with Agent OS

As of Agent OS 2.1, seamless integration with [Claude Code Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) is enabled by default, offering a more context-efficient and intelligent way to apply your coding standards during development.

When enabled, your [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards) are converted into Claude Code Skills that Claude automatically applies when relevant, rather than being explicitly injected into every command and agent instruction.

This page covers:

What are Claude Code Skills
---------------------------

[Claude Code Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) are specialized knowledge modules that Claude can automatically recognize and apply when working on tasks. Unlike explicitly referenced files or triggered subagents, Skills rely on Claude's intelligence to determine when they're relevant.

Each Skill contains:

*   **Content** - The actual coding standards, patterns, or best practices
*   **Description** - Metadata that helps Claude understand when this Skill is relevant
*   **Trigger conditions** - Implicit cues that prompt Claude to activate the Skill

When Skills are used
--------------------

Skills integration is enabled by default in Agent OS 2.1+ and applies when both of these configuration options are set to `true`:

*   `claude_code_commands: true` - You're using Claude Code commands
*   `standards_as_claude_code_skills: true` - Skills integration is enabled (default)

You can verify or modify these settings in your `~/agent-os/config.yml` file:

Copy Copied!

```
defaults:
  profile: default
  claude_code_commands: true
  use_claude_code_subagents: true
  agent_os_commands: false
  standards_as_claude_code_skills: true  # Skills enabled
```


How Skills integration works
----------------------------

When `standards_as_claude_code_skills` is enabled, Agent OS changes how your standards are applied:

### 

Standard behavior

Without Skills (traditional injection)

Normally, [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards) are explicitly referenced in commands and agent instructions using file references:

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/standards/global/naming.md
@agent-os/standards/backend/api-design.md
@agent-os/standards/frontend/component-patterns.md
```


This approach ensures standards are always available, but it can consume significant context tokens, especially when multiple standards are referenced at once.

### 

Skills mode

With Skills enabled

When Skills are enabled:

1.  **Standards are not injected** - References to standards files are removed from commands and agent instructions
2.  **Skills are compiled** - Each standard file becomes a separate Claude Code Skill
3.  **Skills are installed** - Compiled Skills are placed in your project's `.claude/skills/` folder
4.  **Claude applies them intelligently** - Claude automatically recognizes when to use each Skill based on the current task

Skills vs. injected standards
-----------------------------

Understanding the tradeoffs helps you choose the right approach for your workflow:

#### Claude Code Skills

Benefits:

*   More context-efficient (lower token usage)
*   Automatic, intelligent application by Claude
*   Only relevant Skills are used for each task
*   Cleaner command and agent instructions

Limitations:

*   Cannot be explicitly invoked or guaranteed
*   Relies on Claude's judgment of relevance
*   Requires Claude Code (not available in other tools)

#### Injected Standards

Benefits:

*   Explicit, guaranteed application
*   Direct references ensure standards are read
*   Works with any AI coding tool
*   Predictable behavior

Limitations:

*   Higher token usage
*   All referenced standards consume context
*   Less selective (includes standards that may not apply)

### How Skills are triggered

Unlike Claude Code [subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) (which you explicitly trigger with instructions like "delegate to agent-name") or injected standards (which are specifically referenced), Claude Code Skills cannot be directly invoked.

Skills rely on Claude's natural intelligence to recognize when a particular Skill is relevant to the current task. This happens based on:

*   The Skill's description and metadata
*   The nature of the code being written
*   The context of the current task
*   Patterns Claude recognizes in your request

While this may seem like a limitation (and sometimes it can be), the benefit is significant: Skills are far more context and token efficient compared to reading lots of referenced standards files. Plus, only the most relevant Skill for the current task gets used, making them more targeted and effective.

Improving your Skills
---------------------

By default, each Skill has a basic structure that's usable but not yet optimized. To maximize the effectiveness of your Claude Code Skills and help ensure they get triggered whenever and wherever they should, Agent OS provides the **`/improve-skills`** command.

### What /improve-skills does

This command performs a deep analysis of each Skill and:

*   Analyzes the Skill's content to understand its purpose
*   Identifies key patterns, technologies, and use cases
*   Rewrites and expands the Skill's description
*   Improves "triggerability" by adding relevant metadata
*   Optimizes each Skill for automatic recognition by Claude

### When to run it

Run the improve-skills command:

*   **After initial installation** - Transform basic Skills into optimized ones
*   **When you add new standards** - Ensure new Skills are well-described
*   **When Skills aren't being used** - Improve their descriptions to make them more recognizable
*   **After updating standards content** - Align descriptions with updated content

Copy Copied!

```
/improve-skills
```


#### Tip: Iterative improvement

If you notice certain Skills aren't being applied as often as they should, you can manually edit their descriptions in `.claude/skills/` or re-run `/improve-skills` to refine them further.
