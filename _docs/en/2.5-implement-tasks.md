  Implementing Tasks with Agent OS

The **`implement-tasks`** command provides simple, straightforward implementation of your tasks with your main agent. Perfect for smaller features or when you want direct control.

This phase involves implementing the tasks defined in your tasks.md file. Your agent will work through the task groups and check them off as they're completed.

How to run
----------

### 

Claude Code

Run command, /implement-tasks

When using Agent OS with Claude Code commands enabled, run:

Copy Copied!

```
/implement-tasks
```


### 

Other Tools

Two ways to run this command

When using other AI coding tools, you have two options for running this command:

**Option A: Run all steps in one shot**

This single command instructs your agent to complete the entire implementation process automatically. Some agents perform better at this than others.

Copy Copied!

```
@agent-os/commands/implement-tasks/implement-tasks.md run this
```


**Option B: Run each numbered step manually**

For more control and reliability, you can run each numbered command sequentially. Check your `agent-os/commands/implement-tasks/` folder for the numbered command files.

Congratulations! Your feature is now complete and ready for your final review and polish before shipping.

**Important:** Building with AI agents—with or without Agent OS—is _rarely_ a one-and-done process. You should always review the implementation and add your final polish before shipping.

Your review should also serve as your opportunity to spot patterns in how your agents perform, so that you can optimize your [standards](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards) and [workflows](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/workflows) for better performance and alignment.
